Migration from v2 to v3
-----------------------


Changes to Existing Methods
===========================

GetSearch()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Adds ``raw_query`` method. See :ref:`raw_queries` for more information.

GetFollowers()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Method no longer honors a ``count`` or ``cursor`` parameter. These have been deprecated in favor of making this method explicitly a convenience function to return a list of every ``twitter.User`` who is following the specified or authenticated user. A warning will be raised if ``count`` or ``cursor`` is passed with the expectation that breaking behavior will be introduced in a later version.
* Method now takes an optional parameter of ``total_count``, which limits the number of users to return. If this is not set, the data returned will be all users following the specified user.
* The kwarg ``include_user_entities`` now defaults to ``True``. This was set to ``False`` previously, but would not be included in query parameters sent to Twitter. Without the query parameter in the URL, Twitter would default to returning user_entities, so this change makes this behavior explicit.

GetFriends()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Method no longer honors a ``count`` or ``cursor`` parameter. These have been deprecated in favor of making this method explicitly a convenience function to return a list of every ``twitter.User`` who is followed by the specified or authenticated user. A warning will be raised if ``count`` or ``cursor`` is passed with the expectation that breaking behavior will be introduced in a later version.
* Method now takes an optional parameter of ``total_count``, which limits the number of users to return. If this is not set, the data returned will be all users followed by the specified user.
* The kwarg ``include_user_entities`` now defaults to ``True``. This was set to ``False`` previously, but would not be included in query parameters sent to Twitter. Without the query parameter in the URL, Twitter would default to returning user_entities, so this change makes this behavior explicit.

GetFriendsPaged()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* The third value of the tuple returned by this method is now a list of twitter.User objects in accordance with its doc string rather than the raw data from API.
* The kwarg ``include_user_entities`` now defaults to ``True``. This was set to ``False`` previously, but would not be included in query parameters sent to Twitter. Without the query parameter in the URL, Twitter would default to returning user_entities, so this change makes this behavior explicit.

GetFollowersPaged()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* The third value of the tuple returned by this method is now a list of twitter.User objects in accordance with its doc string rather than the raw data from API.
* The kwarg ``include_user_entities`` now defaults to ``True``. This was set to ``False`` previously, but would not be included in query parameters sent to Twitter. Without the query parameter in the URL, Twitter would default to returning user_entities, so this change makes this behavior explicit and consistent with the previously ambiguous behavior.

GetUserStream()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Parameter 'stall_warning' is now 'stall_warnings' in line with GetStreamFilter and Twitter's naming convention. This should now actually return stall warnings, whereas it did not have any effect previously.

PostUpdate()
++++++++++++
* Now accepts three new parameters: ``media``, ``media_additional_owners``, and ``media_category``. ``media`` can be a URL, a local file, or a file-like object (something with a ``read()`` method), or a list of any combination of the above.
* ``media_additional_owners`` should be a list of user ids representing Twitter users that should be able to use the uploaded media in their tweets. If you pass a list of media, then **additional owners will apply to each object.** If you need more granular control, please use the UploadMedia* methods.
* ``media_category``: Only for use with the AdsAPI. See https://dev.twitter.com/ads/creative/promoted-video-overview if this applies to your application.

GetBlocks()
+++++++++++
* Method no longer accepts parameters ``user_id`` or ``screen_name`` as these are not honored by Twitter. The data returned will be for the authenticated user only.
* Parameter ``cursor`` is no longer accepted -- this method will return **all** users being blocked by the currently authenticated user. If you need paging, please use :py:func:`twitter.api.Api.GetBlocksPaged` instead.


Deprecation
===========

PostMedia()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* This endpoint is deprecated by Twitter. Python-twitter will throw a warning about using the method and advise you to use PostUpdate() instead. There is no schedule for when this will be removed from Twitter.

PostMultipleMedia()
+++++++++++++++++++
* This method should be replaced by passing a list of media objects (either URLs, local files, or file-like objects) to PostUpdate. You are limited to a maximum of 4 media files per tweet.


New Methods
===========

UploadMediaChunked()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* API method allows chunked upload to upload.twitter.com. Similar to Api.PostMedia(), this method can take either a local filename (str), a URL (str), or a file-like object. The image or video type will be determined by ``mimetypes`` (see :py:func:`twitter.twitter_utils.parse_media_file` for details).
* Optionally, you can specify a chunk_size for uploads when instantiating the Api object. This should be given in bytes. The default is 1MB (that is, 1048576 bytes). Any chunk_size given below 16KB will result in a warning: Twitter will return an error if you try to upload more than 999 chunks of data; for example, if you are uploading a 15MB video, then a chunk_size lower than 15729 bytes will result in 1000 APPEND commands being sent to the API, so you'll get an error. 16KB seems like a reasonable lower bound, but if your use case is well-defined, then python-twitter will not enforce this behavior.
* Another thing to take into consideration: if you're working in a RAM-constrained environment, a very large chunk_size will increase your RAM usage when uploading media through this endpoint.
* The return value will be the ``media_id`` of the uploaded file.

UploadMediaSimple()
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Provides the ability to upload a single media file to Twitter without using the ChunkedUpload endpoint. This method should be used on smaller files and reduces the roundtrips from Twitter from three (for UploadMediaChunked) to one.
* Return value is the ``media_id`` of the uploaded file.

GetBlocksPaged()
++++++++++++++++
* Allows you to page through the currently authenticated user's blocked users. Method returns three values: the next cursor, the previous cursor, and a list of ``twitter.User`` instances representing the blocked users.

GetBlocksIDs()
++++++++++++++
* Returns **all** the users currently blocked by the authenticated user as user IDs. The user IDs will be integers.

GetBlocksIDsPaged()
+++++++++++++++++++
* Returns one page, specified by the cursor parameter, of the users currently blocked by the authenticated user as user IDs.
